This work is a portable brain computer interface device used for fatigue detection. The device utilizes brain computer interface technology to study the brain waves of the human body during fatigue and wakefulness. 

    
    Being under fatigue not only easily leads to accidents, 
    but may also have negative impacts on personal health. 
    Therefore, accurate monitoring and timely intervention of individual fatigue status 
    is of great significance for improving work efficiency, 
    ensuring traffic safety, and maintaining physical health.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
