I am now a senior student at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests primarily lie in Machine Learning, Nature Language Processing and Bioinformatics. I actively participated in relevant research and published relevant [articles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lLCtLikAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergraduate studies.

Currently, I am working on projects related to EEG signal visualization and fatigue detection. Looking forward, I will be a Ph.D. student at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) majoring in Computer Science in Fall 2024. You can find my CV [here](../files/ZhenghaoHe_CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto://wff7ad@virginia.edu).
