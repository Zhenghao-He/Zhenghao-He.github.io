I am a Ph.D. student at at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~az9eg/website/home.html). My research interests primarily lie in Concept Learning, XAI. 

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2024 from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I was a member of the [Tongji Affective Computing Lab](https://github.com/TJ-ACLAB) under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoliang Gong](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1385/10780.htm). You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/Zhenghao He_CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto://zhenghao@virginia.edu).
