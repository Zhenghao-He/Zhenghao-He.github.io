I am an incoming Ph.D. student at at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~az9eg/website/home.html). My research interests primarily lie in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics. I actively participated in relevant research and published [articles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lLCtLikAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergraduate studies.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2024 from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I was a member of the [Tongji Affective Computing Lab](https://github.com/TJ-ACLAB) under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoliang Gong](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1385/10780.htm). Currently, I am working on projects related to EEG Signal Processing and Fatigue Detection. 
You can find my CV [here](../assets/pdf/Zhenghao He_CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto://wff7ad@virginia.edu).
